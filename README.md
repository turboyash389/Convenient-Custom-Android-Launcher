# Convenient Custom Android Launcher
This is an Convenient Custom Android Launcher made using Android Studio which is used to customize the homescreen of your smartphone.

## Objective: 
The Aim was to provide an application for better utilization of a Smart Phone for the respective user age group.\
Users above the age fifty and further have difficulty in looking for apps in their phone\
due its default icon size and number of apps installed in them.\
Similarly the younger generations like to keep their phone look minimalistic\
with reduced icon size and highlighting the wallpapers in background.\
Hence to provide a solution for this, I came up with an idea of developing\
Convenient Custom Launcher ~ "Launcher Demo" app that allows all the users of different age\
group to customize their Smartphone Home Screen as per their wish.\
Launcher is the name given Android UI that lets users customize the Home Screen

* User can choose Wallpaper from his gallery and can just swipe up from bottom to\
open the app drawer which contains the list of apps installed in the device.
* User can also create app shortcuts by selecting apps from his app drawer to his Home screen page.
* User can also adjust the grid size of the home screen pages by editing in settings of\
the Launcher, by editing it the icon size can be increased or decreased.
